Automates course creation from video content by orchestrating AI server communication via webhooks and SSE streams. The module handles job lifecycle management, user approvals, and real-time progress updates.

### 🎯 Core Functionality

The **GenAI module** facilitates end-to-end automation of course generation from video content by coordinating with an external AI server and providing a seamless developer and user experience:

- **Job Orchestration**: Validates incoming requests, persists job metadata, and queues tasks for segmentation, transcription, question generation, and content assembly.
- **AI Server Coordination**: Utilizes `WebhookService` to send control messages—such as start, continue, abort, and rerun—to the AI engine and handles its asynchronous responses via webhooks.
- **Task Management**: Records individual task states (e.g., segmentation, summarization, question creation) in a dedicated task collection to allow granular progress tracking and error handling.
- **User Approval Workflow**: Offers endpoints to approve or modify AI-generated outputs at each stage—segment maps, question data, and transcripts—before proceeding to the next task.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Establishes a Server‑Sent Events (SSE) stream for front‑end clients to receive live updates on job progress, task completions, and actionable prompts.
- **Webhooks Handling**: Implements a webhook endpoint to receive AI server callbacks, update job and task records in the database, and broadcast events to connected SSE clients.

### 🔁 Typical Workflow

1. **Initiation**: The front-end invokes the module to create a new GenAI job, providing video or playlist identifiers along with target course/version information. The controller validates and delegates to `GenAIService`, which persists the job.
2. **Task Execution**: `GenAIService` dispatches tasks to the AI server via `WebhookService`. Each subtask—such as cutting video segments, generating text transcripts, and crafting quiz questions—is tracked separately in the task repository.
3. **Webhook Reception**: As the AI engine completes tasks, it triggers webhooks to our `WebhookController`. This controller updates both job-level and task-level records and relays status events over the SSE channel.
4. **Live Updates**: Front-end clients subscribing to the SSE endpoint receive JSON‑encoded events indicating progress metrics, task results, or error notifications, enabling dynamic UI updates.
5. **User Interactions**: At critical points, users can approve AI results (e.g., refining segment boundaries, editing questions, adjusting transcripts) via API calls. Successful approvals automatically enqueue the next task.
6. **Completion**: Upon final approval, the module assembles the AI‑generated segments, questions, and metadata into structured course content, ready for review or publication.
