### 3.1 Controllers (Express + routing-controllers)

- **What**: Expose REST endpoints and map incoming requests to service calls.
- **Where**: `src/modules/<module>/controllers/*.ts`
- **Key Roles**:
  - Parse and validate input via `class-validator`.
  - Delegate to Services.
  - Format and send HTTP responses (standard codes and payloads).

**Why?** Decorator-driven routing (e.g. `@Get`, `@Post`) keeps routing definitions close to handler logic, improving readability and reducing boilerplate.

### 3.2 Services (Business Logic)

- **What**: Encapsulate all business rules, orchestration, and cross-repository workflows.
- **Where**: `src/modules/<module>/services/*.ts`
- **Key Roles**:
  - Transactional operations spanning multiple repositories.
  - Input sanitization and domain validation.
  - Integration with third-party systems (e.g., Firebase, Sentry, GenAI SDK).

**Why?** Centralizing logic in Services prevents Controllers from becoming fat and simplifies unit testing by isolating business behaviors.

### 3.3 Repositories (Data Access)

- **What**: Abstract MongoDB CRUD operations behind domain-specific methods.
- **Where**: `src/modules/<module>/repositories/*.ts`
- **Key Roles**:
  - Define entity schemas and indexes.
  - Provide methods like `findById`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, and advanced queries.
  - Manage sessions for transactional writes.

**Why?** The repository pattern decouples database concerns from business logic, making it easier to swap implementations or mock data stores in tests.

### 3.4 Dependency Injection (InversifyJS)

- **What**: Automatically wire Controllers, Services, and Repositories together using injectable symbols.
- **Where**: `src/container.ts`, plus `types.ts` for symbol definitions.
- **Why?** DI promotes loose coupling, enables easy mocking for tests, and enforces clear contract boundaries between layers.
