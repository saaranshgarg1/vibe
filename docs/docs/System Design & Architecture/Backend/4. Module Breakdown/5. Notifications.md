### 🎯 Core Responsibilities

- **Invitation Generation**: Validates roles and course context, then issues unique invite tokens linked to courseId and versionId.
- **Email Delivery**: `MailService` formats HTML emails using configurable templates and sends via SMTP (using Nodemailer).
- **Invite Processing**: Web endpoint renders a redirect page or JSON response upon token consumption, guiding users to enrollment flows.
- **Resend & Cancel**: Allows authorized users to resend pending invites or revoke them, updating invite status accordingly.
- **Permission Enforcement**: Uses CASL abilities to ensure only permitted roles (e.g., instructors, TAs) can invite, view, or manage invites.

### 🔁 Workflow

1. **Create Invites**: Authorized user submits a list of email addresses and roles; `InviteController` delegates to `InviteService`.
2. **Persist Invites**: `InviteService` generates tokens, saves invite records via `InviteRepository`, and calls `MailService` to send emails.
3. **Process Invitations**: Recipients click invite links; `InviteController.processInvites` validates token, marks it consumed, and redirects to the front-end enrollment page.
4. **Manage Invites**: Instructors can view all invites for a course version, resend emails, or cancel pending invitations through dedicated endpoints.
