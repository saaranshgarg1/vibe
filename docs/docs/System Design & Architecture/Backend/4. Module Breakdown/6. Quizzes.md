### 🎯 Component Responsibilities
- **Controllers**: Expose RESTful endpoints; validate input via DTOs; enforce CASL policies via `@Authorized` and ability decorators.
- **Services**: Contain core business workflows—quiz lifecycle, bank management, question operations, attempt grading and scoring.
- **Repositories**: Abstract MongoDB operations for quizzes, questions, banks, and attempts; support transactions and pagination.
- **Abilities**: Define fine-grained access rules for CRUD operations and attempt submissions.
- **Question Processing**: Modular pipeline to render questions, parse custom tags, validate business rules, and apply grading strategies.
- **Interfaces & Types**: Ensure type-safe contracts for grading algorithms, repository methods, and DTOs.
- **Dependency Injection**: `container.ts` binds interfaces to implementations using Inversify’s `@injectable` and `@inject`, promoting loose coupling and easy testing.

### 🔁 Interaction Flow
1. **Quiz Definition**: Instructors create quizzes and attach question banks via `QuizController`.
2. **Question Management**: Questions authored via `QuestionController`, validated, and stored in banks.
3. **Attempt Lifecycle**: Students initiate attempts (`AttemptController`), answers processed through `AttemptService` using `QuestionProcessor`.
4. **Scoring & Feedback**: Graders compute scores; results persisted and accessible to users.
5. **Integration**: Module interacts with **Auth** for user identity, **Users** for progress tracking.
