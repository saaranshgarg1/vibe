> Each module lives under `src/modules/<module>`, with its own Controllers, Services, and Repositories.

### 4.1 Authentication

- **Controllers**: `AuthController` (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/token`) exposes sign-up, login, and token endpoints.
- **Service**: `FirebaseAuthService` wraps Firebase Admin SDK for user creation, JWT issuance, and token verification.
- **Repository**: Minimal, since Firebase is the source of truth; local DB used for profile data only.

**Why?** Offloads heavy lifting to Firebase—leveraging its scalability, secure token management, and built-in user lifecycle.

### 4.2 Courses

- **Controllers**: `CourseController` endpoints (`/courses`, `/courses/:id/versions`, etc.)
- **Service**: `CourseService` implements versioning logic, content locking, and draft/publish workflows.
- **Repository**: `CourseRepository` defines schemas for `Course`, `Version`, `Module`, `Section`, and `Item` subdocuments.

**Why?** Versioning courses independently supports safe iteration and rollbacks; keeping content hierarchies in subdocuments optimizes read performance.

### 4.3 Quizzes

- **Controllers**: `QuizController` for managing quizzes and attempts.
- **Service**: `QuizService` uses a factory pattern to handle different question types (SOL, SML, OTL, NAT, DES).
- **Repository**: `QuizRepository`, `QuestionBankRepository`, and `AttemptRepository` separate concerns for question storage vs. attempt tracking.

**Why?** Quiz logic is inherently complex—isolating types and attempts into dedicated repos and services maintains clarity and testability.

### 4.4 Users

- **Controllers**: `UserController` (`/users/:id/enroll`, `/users/:id/progress`)
- **Service**: `EnrollmentService` and `ProgressService` track course enrollments and watch-time.
- **Repository**: `UserRepository` with methods for progress snapshots, watch-time aggregates, and profile updates.

**Why?** Separating enrollment from progress allows flexible business rules (e.g., free vs. paid courses, quiz retakes).

### 4.5 Notifications

- **Controllers**: `NotificationController` (`/notifications/invite`, `/notifications/status`)
- **Service**: `MailService` (SMTP) and `InviteService` manage email invites and status tracking.
- **Repository**: `InviteRepository` stores invite tokens, expiration, and status.

**Why?** Decoupling email transport from invite logic simplifies swapping providers or adding in-app notification channels later.

### 4.6 Settings

- **Controllers**: `SettingsController` (`/settings/proctoring`, `/settings/custom`)
- **Service**: `SettingsService` reads/writes course- and user-level settings.
- **Repository**: `SettingsRepository` with JSON-schema–validated storage.

**Why?** Proctoring and custom flags vary by course; having a dedicated module keeps these concerns isolated.

### 4.7 Anomalies

- **Controllers**: `AnomalyController` (`/anomalies`, `/anomalies/:id`)
- **Service**: `AnomalyService` subscribes to watch-time events and applies threshold rules.
- **Repository**: `AnomalyRepository` stores anomaly records with metadata (userId, courseId, timestamp).

**Why?** Early detection of suspicious behavior protects academic integrity and platform health.

### 4.8 GenAI

- **Controllers**: `GenAIController` (`/genai/questions`, `/genai/summaries`)
- **Service**: `GenAIService` wraps OpenAI (or Ollama) clients, handles prompt templates and rate limits.
- **Repository**: Optionally caches generated content in `GenAIRepository` to avoid redundant API calls.

**Why?** Centralizing prompt engineering and caching improves consistency, costs control, and performance.
