# Intern Workflow Guide

This guide outlines the day-to-day workflow and expectations for interns at ViBe. Following these practices will help you integrate smoothly with the team and contribute effectively to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**
   - Follow the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/intro.md)
   - Make sure all tools and dependencies are properly installed
   
2. **Introduce yourself in GitHub Discussions**
    - Introduce yourself in [#introduction](https://github.com/continuousactivelearning/vibe/discussions/249) on GitHub discussions.
   
4. **Review documentation**
   - Read through this onboarding documentation
   - Familiarize yourself with the [Project Structure](../getting-started/project-structure.md)

## Daily Workflow

### Communicate
Be prepared to share:

1. What you accomplished yesterday
2. What you plan to work on today
3. Any blockers or challenges you're facing

### Task Assignment

1. Tasks will be assigned to you through github issues
2. Each task will include:
   - Description of the feature or bug fix
   - Due date (if applicable)
3. If you want to work on a particular Issue, comment on it. Soon, one of the managers of the repository will assign you the issue if he/she deems fit. 
4. Further, see [Contributing](../category/contributing/) to learn how to properly contribute to the project.

### Code Review Process

1. **Respond to feedback**
   - Address all comments and feedback from reviewers
   - Make requested changes and push updates
   - Respond to each comment to mark it as resolved

2. **Iterate as needed**
   - Be prepared to make multiple rounds of changes
   - Ask questions if you need clarification on feedback

3. **Merge when approved**
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged by a maintainer
   - Keep your local repository updated with the main branch

## Learning and Growth

### Weekly Check-ins

We schedule weekly meetings to:
- Review your progress
- Provide feedback
- Address any concerns
- Set goals for the coming week

### Learning Resources

Take advantage of our recommended resources:
- Review the [Tech Stack Overview](./tech-stack.md) for learning materials
- Ask for code walkthroughs when dealing with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

### Contribution Expectations

As an intern, you're expected to:
1. Complete assigned tasks within reasonable timeframes
2. Actively communicate about progress and blockers
3. Seek help when needed rather than getting stuck
4. Gradually increase your understanding of the codebase
5. Contribute to documentation as you learn

## FAQ for Interns

**Q: What should I do if I finish a task early?**  
A: Notify a maintainer and ask for the next priority task, or take initiative on improving documentation.

**Q: How much help should I ask for?**  
A: We encourage questions! Try to solve problems independently first, but don't spend more than 30-60 minutes stuck before asking for guidance.

**Q: How do I contribute to documentation?**  
A: As you learn and solve problems, consider creating PRs to update our official documentation.

Remember, the goal of your internship is both to contribute valuable work and to learn. We're here to support your growth as a developer!
